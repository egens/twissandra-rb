# Twissandra.rb

Rebuilding Twitter with Ruby and Cassandra

## Genesis

This project owes its existence to the [Twissandra](https://github.com/twissandra/twissandra) project. The schema and naming of entities are largely derived from Twissandra, but the implementation is my own.

## Installation

    $ brew install cassandra
    $ cassandra -f

    $ rvm install jruby
    $ rvm use jruby
    $ bundle install
